The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the tilt switch and the
photoresistor to control the mechanisms of the other elements of the circuit. For this circuit,
the components that will be controlled by the photoresistors will be the LEDs and the active
buzzer. Two photoresistors will be included in the system, the first one is to control the
frequency of the sound along with the number of LEDs that are lighted and the second one is
to control the speed of the buzzer and the sweep motion of LEDs. Lastly, the tilt switch will
be swapping the tasks of these photoresistors. With this system, we will be illustrated how
photoresistors and tilt-switch can be utilized to manipulate the speed and frequency of the
LEDs and the buzzer.
